# Progress ledger

Current state of the build. Updated before every commit; each commit waits for the owner's
diff review (brief §8).

**Now:** Phase 1 ✅ · repo on GitHub with CI · branching strategy on `chore/branching-strategy`
(awaiting review) · next: Phase 2 — Domain and fixtures on `feat/phase-2-domain`

---

## Phase 0 — Repo and design extraction ✅

- [x] Scaffold Next.js 16 · `1d1e936`
- [x] Brief, handoff and mockups in `docs/` · `cfdb3ce`
- [x] `docs/DESIGN-SPEC.md` extracted; open items resolved as `[ASSUMED]` · `cbc3cd2`
- [x] Owner direction recorded (brief §0.1, spec Revision 2) · `85874fd`

## Phase 1 — Foundation ✅

| Step | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Tooling: Prettier (+ Tailwind plugin), Vitest + Testing Library, `lint`/`typecheck`/`format`/`test`/`check` scripts, GitHub Actions CI, ESLint ignores `docs/**`, ledger + working agreement | ✅ `53cc1fe` |
| 1.2 | Token layer: `styles/tokens.css` (both modes, bands, focus ring, reduced motion, grain, keyframes), `app/globals.css` `@theme` mapping, `next/font`, root layout + pre-paint theme script | ✅ `b68ecbb` |
| 1.3 | `/tokens` verification page; template assets removed; home stub at `app/(site)/page.tsx` | ✅ `778ed27` |
| 1.4 | Verification (below) + CLAUDE.md commands refreshed | ✅ `05772a6` |
| 1.5 | GitHub remote (private `Tanishk-Saxena/portfolio_v2`), first CI run green on `main` | ✅ |
| 1.6 | Branching strategy + safeguards: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, PR template, local hooks blocking commits/pushes to `main`, `.gitattributes` for hooks, repo merge settings (squash/rebase only, delete on merge), CI actions bumped to v5 | built, awaiting review |

Verification checklist (brief §6, adjusted: everything local first):
- [x] Local production build renders `/tokens` with every token in both modes. Screenshots
      checked at 1440px (side by side) and 390px (true 390px iframe): fonts load, dark
      accent is derived, band fill stays the same in both modes, no horizontal overflow.
- [x] Lint gate rejects a deliberately introduced error (`no-var` → exit 1), and is clean
      again after the revert (exit 0).
- [x] The same rejection **in CI**: throwaway PR #1 failed at `npm run lint` on the planted
      `no-var`, then was closed and its branch deleted.
- [ ] Server-side enforcement (ruleset: PR required, `check` required): GitHub returns 403
      for private repos on the free plan. Needs the repo public or GitHub Pro (owner decision).
- Deployment (host choice and setup) is **deferred to Phase 5**, by owner decision.

## Phase 2 — Domain and fixtures (next)

Domain types from spec §7 · repository interfaces (all async) · fixture implementations ·
`lib/container.ts` · interface-level contract tests · stress fixture set with awkward
content · ESLint rule blocking `app/` and `components/` from importing repositories.

Started early (uncommitted, on hold): `lib/domain/types.ts`.

## Phase 3 — Public site · Phase 4 — Motion · Phase 5 — Ship

Not started.

## Notes / decisions made during the build

- `@types/node` bumped to `^24` (Vitest 5 peer requirement; local Node is 26).
- Tailwind colour utilities are named `paper`, `surface`, `ink`, `muted`, `accent`, `accent-fill`
  (e.g. `bg-paper`, `text-ink`), so `bg-bg` / `text-text` are avoided.
- Dark mode is attribute-driven: `@custom-variant dark` on `[data-theme='dark']`.
- `typecheck` runs `next typegen` first, because `LayoutProps`/`PageProps` are generated.
- Headless Chrome won't size its window below ~500px; use a 390px iframe for mobile screenshots.
